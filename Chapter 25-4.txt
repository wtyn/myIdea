It's not clear what exactly was causing Ms. Zizek's temper so quickly.

"I am sorry, I'm not a good person," she says.

Her daughter, who was born in the United States and lives in Denmark, says she is not sure what he did to her. "I'm just scared for my life. I don't know what happened and I don't know if he's going to be punished for it or not," she says.

In the last few days, Ms. Zizek has been taken to a hospital in Copenhagen where she is being treated for severe head trauma. She says she is now in a coma.

"I am really scared," she says. "I'm scared for my life. I don't know where I am going to go. I'm not sure where I am going to go. I'm not sure if he's going to be punished for it or not," she says.

A spokesman for the Justice Ministry told RFE/RL that Mr. Zizek has already been arrested on charges of "criminal fraud."

The prime minister's office did not respond to requests for comment on the case.

The case is in Denmark's financial and social affairs court.

The United States has been the latest country to step up pressure on Mr. Zizek, who has a reputation for being a hard-line anti-immigration and anti-establishment candidate.

Mr. Zizek, an Austrian who has led a campaign to ban same-sex marriage, has also faced criticism for his anti-immigration stance.

Mr. Zizek's campaign has called for a ban on same-sex marriage, saying it would create a "religious test" for people to be married in the United States.
