Ravens cut Diontae Johnson to end disastrous post-trade marriage - New York Post  (via CSNPhilly)
The Eagles cut cornerback Brandon Boykin as a sign of the times.  The Eagles cut safety Nick Foles.  The Eagles went with a player who's been a top receiver over the past four years and who could replace the injured Robert Woods.  What the Eagles did with a guy like that was pretty bad.  The Eagles didn't do that because they were afraid to take their franchise player away from them.  They did it because they felt they had a great chance at another quarterback who could take them to the playoffs.  
The Eagles made a $6 million deal for cornerback Chris Culliver as part of the deal.  The Eagles made a $4 million deal this summer for linebacker D'Qwell Jackson, who was a restricted free agent.  Jackson is in his fourth season with the Eagles, but he left for the New York Jets.  The Eagles knew Jackson wouldn't get any playing time, so they brought him back in for a seventh-round pick in July.
