Ukraine says it has hit one of Russia’s largest oil refineries in a drone strike - CNN reported.‖

Kirill Putin on Sunday said he "will be ready for any attack" after the strike that killed three of his countrymen and injured seven others at the facility.

"We will be ready for any attack, but we must not wait for this event to go to the next level," he told reporters in Moscow.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would not give military support to the United States.

"Russia will not give military support to the United States, but we will support it," Peskov told reporters.

Washington has been the main target of Islamic State militants since the group was captured in Syria in March. The group, which says it is based in Iraq and Syria, has expanded out of Syria, Iraq and the Levant.

Putin was in Moscow for a meeting of leaders of the world's top oil exporters, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, which together account for 12 per cent of the world's production.

"Our priority is to prevent the spread of the Islamic State and to prevent the spread of terrorism and extremism," he told reporters in a televised address at the Moscow-Washington Summit for the Third International to be held on Friday.

Putin said his government is ready to intervene to stop the militants, but stressed that the United States is not a threat to the stability of the region.

"As for the United States, I want to say that we will not be involved in the war on terrorism," Putin said.
