US Measles Outbreak Surges Towards 100 Cases - ScienceAlert

A new study highlights a new path to preventing, treating and responding to measles in children.

The study team from the University of California, San Francisco, developed a vaccine designed to protect against measles in infants and children.

The vaccine, developed by the researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, is expected to be ready by the end of the year.

The vaccine is designed to prevent measles in infants and children in the U.S.

It's been designed to protect against measles in the first place using a combination of vaccines, including chikungunya, rotavirus vaccines and measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.

Researchers used the technology to study the immune system of the infants.

The study, published in the journal Immunity, was conducted at the University of California, San Francisco, using a group of 10,000 children.
