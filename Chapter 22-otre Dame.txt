Notre Dame vs. Indiana score, takeaways: Irish prove too much for overmatched Hoosiers, notch first CFP win - CBS Sports

9:45 p.m.

It's the end of the season, and it's time for a team to get back into the game and prove they're still the best in the nation.

The game will make it to the CFP semifinals on Sunday evening against the unbeaten Indiana Hoosiers.

A win would put the Hoosiers out of the playoff race and give the Hoosiers their first win of the season after blowing a 10-point lead in the second half of the regular season.

Indiana came into the game with one of the better record in college football. The Fighting Irish have won three straight contests and are third in the AP Poll.

The Hoosiers return to action Saturday in a game against the defending national champion Illinois State Fighting Illini.

The Hoosiers (6-3, 2-0 Big Ten) have yet to lose in eight games on the road
