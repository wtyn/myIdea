LAWRENCE COUNTY, Ga. (WSJ) - A federal judge in Jefferson County has ordered federal officials to stop paying the state's $9 million in unpaid taxes before they start paying the state's $7.5 million in unpaid taxes.

The judge ruled in favor of the Jefferson County district attorney's office to stop paying the state's $9 million in unpaid taxes.

The judge also ordered the county to stop paying the state's $7.5 million in unpaid taxes.

Jackson County Attorney Joe Ferencini, said he was pleased with the ruling and he expects the Justice Department to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

"We're hopeful so that we can get this resolved here to a full, thorough and fair resolution," Ferencini said.

Ferencini said while the county is paying its debts, "we're not doing anything, we're not going to pay the rest of this. We're paying what we owe."

It is not clear if the federal courts will decide the case with the state or its federal counterparts as this is still under investigation by the Justice Department.

Ferencini said it is his hope that the state will be able to pay its debt in full before the U.S. Supreme Court issues an order.
