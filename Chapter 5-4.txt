Trump’s ‘state secrets’ claim over deportation flight details breaks with past practice - CNN https://t.co/RXwQj2PxQp — CNNPolitics (@CNNPolitics) November 6, 2017

Trump is correct in claiming the information to be from "the highest level of the Chinese government" and is not doing anything wrong. He's saying that if anyone has any sort of information about the alleged Trump Tower meeting, it's him.

As the Trump Organization's lawyer, Bill Browder said, "The information has not been released, and we do not have any way to know it."

Trump called the claims "bizarre," according to CNN.

"I think it is bizarre that we are so far from seeing these documents," Browder said. "I think it is very, very, very bizarre. It is highly unusual."

Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has also denied any connection to the alleged Trump Tower meeting.

"We were talking about it yesterday, about a picture of Donald Trump," Trump Jr. said at the time. "We were talking about it yesterday, about a picture of a man in a suit and tie saying 'The next one is from China.' "
