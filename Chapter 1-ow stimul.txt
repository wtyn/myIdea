How stimulating the bodyâ€™s largest nerve may relieve severe depression - CNN

A man who claims he suffered from anxiety disorder or depression had his mental health treatment taken away in May.

Mr. C.K. said he was treated with antidepressants and has no problems with depression.

"I'm fine," he said, "but I have to take this medication and I'll be fine."

C.K., 24, was arrested on May 5 after authorities say he tried to use a computer to get help after he had been living with his parents in a small town in South Carolina. After the arrest, he told authorities he became irritable and paranoid and wanted to kill himself.

After the arrest, he told authorities he had tried to kill himself because he feared he would suffer from depression, but was unable to commit suicide.

He was arrested by police at a home in Charlotte, North Carolina, after he allegedly threatened to kill himself.
