US moves ahead on tariffs with investigations into computer chips and pharmaceuticals - AP News

A report from Reuters says the US will continue to trade with Cuba if the embargo is lifted, with the US also monitoring the country's economic activities and pursuing a "strategic partnership."

Reuters reports that the US is also considering a plan to trade with the island of Cuba if the embargo is lifted, with the US also monitoring the country's economic activities and pursuing a "strategic partnership."

The US Department of Commerce said that the embargo on Cuba is "not an issue of trade, it is an issue of policy."

"The Department of Commerce is aware of the current situation in Cuba and has taken note of the recent developments from the Cuban government and their efforts to resolve this issue through diplomatic efforts and dialogue," the Commerce Department said in a statement.

It's unclear whether the report is anything other than a case of trade, but the Commerce Department has long been concerned that the embargo on Cuba is an issue of policy. (Reporting by Roberta Schiavo, Editing by David Gregorio)
