Donald Trump Sentencing LIVE: President-Elect Handed Unconditional Discharge, Sentence Explained - Newsweek

A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to take down the President-Elect Donald Trump's tweet that he would go after his "mental health" doctors.

Judge Joseph Souter said on Monday that Trump's tweets were "a serious violation" of the Constitution.

"The U.S. Constitution does not support the president-elect's or the president's administration's decision to use executive actions to punish people for exercising their constitutionally protected right to free speech and free association," Souter said.

He said Trump's tweet "is the latest example of the president's actions that are unconstitutional and dangerous in the United States of America."

The judge also ordered that a judge must look into Trump's campaign's handling of the matter.

Trump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
