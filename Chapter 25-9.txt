9 Things the Cameras Missed During the Spirit Awards - Hollywood Reporter

One of the most fascinating parts of the Awards is the way that the cameras are used to find the audience. When the cameras are on, the audience is as always very much in control of the camera as they were when I was in the audience with them.

One of the big things about the cameras is that they are very easy to find and very easy to turn around. They're not very bulky, they're very portable and they're very easy to pick up.

One of the things that's been different about this year's awards is that I've decided to give the camera a shot all the way through in a single shot. I think that's a very nice change of pace.

This year, I've decided to take the camera to a different location and I've taken it to some different places. I've taken pictures of the stage and I've taken some of the backstage area, and I've taken some of the big crowds that we've been seeing.

Now, the cameras are not all that different, but the experience they provide is different.
