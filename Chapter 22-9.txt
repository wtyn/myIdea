The death of a kayaker at the Canyons Bay area of the United States prompted a massive outcry, and the state of New Jersey issued a warning to all kayakers in the area.

U.S. Marine Mammal Protection was on the scene at Canyons Bay about 15 minutes after the whales came ashore. The whale, which had been swimming for a few minutes, was eating at least one of the kayakers' kayaks.

The whale was feeding and was about to swallow the kayakers and get in one of the kayaks, the State of New Jersey said on its Facebook page.

It added that it was aware of the whales' activities and that it was assisting the kayakers.

According to the state, the whales are a large and dangerous species that are found on island waters in the Great Lakes and Gulf of Mexico.

The whale began attacking the kayakers on Monday, the state said, and the kayakers were able to make an escape.

The state called the whales a "disappointing sight," but rescuers said they could find no signs of life on the whales' bodies.

The state says it is working with the state Department of Natural Resources and the state Coast Guard to retrieve the bodies, which should be able to be returned within three days.

The state said the kayakers' last known location was on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico.

The state has said at least two whales have been killed at Canyons
