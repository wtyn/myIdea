Biden just unveiled Americaâ€™s ambitious new climate goal. Trump will assuredly undo it - CNN's Jake Tapper spoke to him about the idea on CNN's "State of the Union" Wednesday.

Trump is already taking steps to undo a policy that was meant to help the U.S. win the Paris agreement. The president has also pledged to push the U.S. toward a new energy policy, arguing that it will help the industry.

Trump is also set to cut the Environmental Protection Agency's budget by nearly $1 billion, in a move that could result in an increase in the number of coal-fired power plants.

The cuts to the EPA are also expected to affect the EPA's ability to carry out its mission of protecting the environment, especially on coal-fired power plants.

Trump's plan to withdraw the United States from the Paris accord, which has been in place since 1994, is a key policy goal of his administration.
