Rapid spread of H5N1 bird flu through California dairy herds suggests unknown paths of transmission - STAT

"Our study provides a unique opportunity to examine the role of agricultural inputs in the H5N1 outbreak in California. We show that the agricultural inputs of H5N1 are not only detrimental to agriculture and the health of California's vulnerable populations, but are also risk factors for the spread of H5N1 and other highly infectious diseases. We also show that the long-term management of H5N1 is unlikely to provide adequate protection against this serious disease."

The study was published in the journal Science Advances.
