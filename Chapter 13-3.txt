Man who last saw missing student Sudiksha Konanki has left Dominican Republic after getting new passport - CNN Philippines

Konanki was last seen leaving the country in October on a bicycle.

Her family confirmed she was a student at the University of the Philippines in the south of the country.

"We are now in shock and are talking with our family members and friends," Kwanjikin's mother, Isabella Kwanjikin, told CNN Philippines.

"We are asking everyone to help us find her. She is now in the hospital and we are trying to find her brother. We are praying for her."

Investigators said the woman had been in the Philippines for more than 15 years and appeared to be in good health.

Investigators have so far been unable to find any criminal charges against her.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is assisting in the case.

A search of the Philippine National Police headquarters in Manila is underway.
