Fatal beating of Black inmate in New York draws probes, outrage - Axios

One inmate in custody, who faces possible assault charges, was found dead in a cell on Tuesday.

At a press conference, a judge said the death was "an early tragedy, and an act of terrible violence." The death is believed to "take place on a Friday night."

The death was first reported by the Times.

Judge Ann Curry said the inmate (shown in a hospital gown) "was taken to the hospital for an assessment and was pronounced dead at 7 p.m.... There was no foul play."

The New York Daily News reported that the inmate, identified only as "Ninth-Grade" and "Avery," was "bonded for the death of a juvenile inmate," according to the Daily News.

The inmate has not been charged in the death.

"As has been the norm for years, this incident has a tragic nature," the judge said. "The defendant has been charged with assault with intent to kill. The defendant is a dangerous criminal who was convicted in the 2012 federal prison-industrial complex fraud case.

"We would like to commend the criminal prosecution team for their investigation and the prosecutor's commitment to the rule of law and the rule of justice."
