Trump says he might demand Panama hand over canal - Reuters Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in Toronto on Friday a secret plan to build a canal from one of the Pacific's major shipping lanes to the other would be a "huge mistake".

Trudeau made the comments at the Toronto International Airport under the Canadian flag as he prepared to meet with European Union leaders next week in Brussels.

"We need to do that right now. And we've got to do that right now. And that's what we're going to do," Trudeau said.

Canada has been building a new, more flexible route through the Panama Canal for years. It has also been building a new system of natural gas pipelines, called CNG, through the Panama Canal since 1991.

Trudeau said the new route should be completed by 2020 and the canal could be built on the existing pipeline.

"A new route will be built and we will have a new, more efficient and more efficient way to transport Canadian goods to Europe," he said.

"We will be able to move our goods to Europe, and we will have a new, more efficient and more efficient way to transport Canadian goods to Europe."

Trudeau said the Panama Canal will become the world's largest waterway by 2025, and the new canal should be able to run up to 3,000 kilometres (1,800 kilometres) across the Atlantic Ocean.

"It's a huge step," Trudeau said.
