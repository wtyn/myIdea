Dire fire warning for LA area pushed back as winds ease - POLITICO Read more

The California Fire Department's own reports indicate that the fire was contained in the West Sacramento Valley, but officials said there was still considerable smoke on the area Tuesday.

The fire was a joint effort of the California State Fire Marshal's Office and the California State Fire Marshal's Office on the West Sacramento portion of the city.

The state fire marshal said there were no reports of smoke on the east side of the fire line.

The wildfire is expected to burn through the city of Merced, with reports of smoke coming from neighboring Sierra Nevada that could get to the city of Santa Cruz and from the area of Napa and Sonoma counties.

The San Francisco Bay Area is also on fire. The state has issued a severe fire preparedness alert for San Francisco.

The state's National Weather Service has issued a wildfire preparedness alert for coastal areas in San Francisco. The alert is based on three separate scenarios:

A fire with over 100 acres of smoke

A wildfire with at least 100 acres of smoke

An active fire in the central San Francisco area

A wildfire that has exceeded its target

State fire marshals have also issued a warning for the San Francisco and San Jose areas.

"The fire conditions are just as bad as they were yesterday," said Fire Chief John T. Sullivan. "Now we have to prepare for the worst."

There may be more smoke on the ground in the San Francisco area.

Sandy Lees, spokesman for the San Francisco Fire Department, said the fire is at a high level of containment. He said it's not clear how long the fire will last.

"We have no idea how this fire will spread," he said. "We are confident that it will slow down."
