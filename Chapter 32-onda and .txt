Honda and Nissan unveil plan for $58bn merger by 2026 - Financial Times

Nissan plans to use the profits from the two divisions to buy up a portion of North American carmakers like Toyota, which is being acquired by Ford for $3.3bn.

The move would help Nissan boost its share price by more than 50 per cent, and would help boost its share price by as much as 20 per cent as it sells cars, analysts said.

"If North American carmakers can buy up the margins from the Japanese carmakers, they can increase their profitability," said Jim Hall, director of research at McKinsey & Co. "And if the Japanese carmakers can buy up the margins from the Japanese carmakers, they can increase their profitability."

Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn said the merger would help the Japanese carmakers "make a move towards a global car market that we believe will become a global one."

The deal would let the Japanese company expand its car business by 40 per cent by 2026, and the United States, which is expected to drive the car industry, would drive the United States to Nissan's global market share.

A Nissan spokesman said: "The company does not comment on speculation at this time.

"Nissan's plans are being discussed with the U.S. government and with the European Commission. The carmaker's current market share is around 40 per cent."

Nissan expects to make up to $3bn in profits from the merger in the first half of 2019, but the company, which makes the Nissan Leaf, has raised concerns about its share price since last quarter.

Its shares have fallen as much as 5 per cent in the past four weeks, while its shares have increased by 2 per cent in the past 24 hours.

The plan would provide the largest shareholders with a $58bn loss by selling the share of the Nissan shares that it sold last month.
