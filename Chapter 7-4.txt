A river that washed through an area of Cincinnati's southwest last week has been washed off of the river and into the river's river bank.


The river was washed off by a combination of mud and sand, according to a report from the Cincinnati Enquirer.


The report said the creek was near the city of Cincinnati and was about 50 yards wide.


The river was headed south in the direction of the town of Cincinnati, KRCTV reported.


It is unclear if the river is now on its way back to the river.


Authorities are urging people to stay away from the river, and to avoid flooding areas.


"We know what's happening in the river and we're trying to keep it as safe as we can," Cincinnati Fire Department Lt. Mike Kipnis told reporters Sunday.


The river is a major source of pollution in the state, with more than 7,000 people making the trip each year
