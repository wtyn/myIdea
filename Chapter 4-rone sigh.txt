Drone sightings unsettle New Jersey residents: ‘It’s been super-scary’ - The Washington Post

A woman told the Post she saw a man standing near the house in New Jersey's Upper Peninsula Wednesday.

It was about 5:40 p.m., after her husband called her from a nearby neighborhood.

The woman said she heard the man and was upset. She said she could hear a woman say, "Hey, man, you don't look like you mean to be here."

"I'm a woman and I can hear all of that," she said.

She said she had been in the neighborhood three months and had never heard of anyone harassing her.

"I've got a wife and a child," she said. "They're just so stupid."

A police detective told the Post that she was traveling with the woman to her house when the man came and then began speaking.
