Italian journalist Cecilia Sala released by Iran - The Washington Post.

"I don't know if I can make this story up. I've been working for years for this newspaper to get it published, and I'm sorry that the Iranian government has not published it," Sala said, according to a transcript obtained by CNN.

Sala was in Iran last week for a conference on human rights, including the release of four Iranian prisoners on human rights violations.

"I'm sorry. I am not an Iranian citizen. I don't want to speak to you. I'm not an American citizen. I believe in justice. I don't want to be an American citizen. I don't want to be an American citizen."
