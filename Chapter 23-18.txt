Senate confirms Russell Vought to lead White House budget office - The Washington Post

In the wake of the Senate's announcement, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said she had no plans to run for re-election in 2018.

Murray, who is running for re-election to the Senate seat she held in 2013, told reporters on the Senate floor after the announcement that she is keeping her head down as she continues to work on her 2018 campaign.

"I think it's important to keep my head down, and I think that I'm going to continue to work on this until I really, really pull the wool over my eyes, and I think that I have to make sure that I can do that," she said.

Murray's office said she was "disappointed" when "the Senate voted unanimously to confirm Senator Russell Vought to serve as a budget director."
