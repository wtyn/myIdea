(CNN) Two people were killed and three others injured when a boat struck a fishing boat in Alabama Thursday night at the Alabama fishing tournament, police said.

Alabama State Police Lt. Tom Scott said the boat pulled over by the boat's captain while it was sailing at 1:30 p.m. Thursday night was hit by the boat's propeller, hitting a reef.

The driver of the boat, a 22-year-old man, was taken to a hospital in critical condition. The wreck is being treated as a homicide.

Police say the crew of the boat was conducting an emergency landing.

"We're trying to make sure that we have the right people in the right boat and that we have a crew that follows the boat to keep us safe," Scott said. "This is a collision of a very high caliber and the safety of all of us."
